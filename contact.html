    <h2>Our Scientific Path</h2>

    <p>
      Fasting has been used in our clinics for more than 100 years.
      It began with Dr Otto Buchinger, who observed that carefully guided fasting
      could cure the debilitating rheumatoid arthritis that had confined him to a wheelchair.
    </p>

    <p>
      For a long time, this knowledge was mainly clinical.
      Patients improved, doctors observed, and the method was transmitted through experience.
    </p>

    <p>
      Then medicine changed.
      From the second half of the twentieth century, scientific evidence became essential.
      At medical conferences, a simple question was asked more and more often:
      where are your studies?
    </p>

    <p>
      Dr Françoise Wilhelmi de Toledo took this question seriously.
      Instead of defending tradition alone, she decided to build evidence.
      She created a scientific department and developed strong connections with leading universities.
    </p>

    <p>
      She trained a PhD student whose doctoral work was carried out at Charité Berlin,
      Dr Franziska Grundler, bringing the highest academic standards directly into the clinic.
      From that moment, fasting at Buchinger Wilhelmi was no longer only a medical practice.
      It became a field of scientific research.
    </p>

    <p>
      Over the years, thousands of patients followed the programme under medical supervision.
      We did not only care for them. We studied what happened in their bodies.
      Blood pressure. Blood sugar. Inflammation. Muscle function.
      The gut microbiome. The nervous system.
    </p>

    <p>
      This is how we learned that fasting is not just about weight loss.
      It helps the body switch energy sources, calm inflammation, unload the liver,
      and move from constant stress to recovery mode.
    </p>

    <p>
      What we observed was confirmed by the scientific community.
      The number of research groups studying fasting increased steadily.
      In 2016, the Nobel Prize in Medicine was awarded to Yoshinori Ohsumi
      for his discoveries on autophagy, a key cellular regeneration process activated during fasting.
    </p>

    <p>
      We also studied what people fear most.
      Loss of muscle. Weakness. Safety.
      Using advanced tools such as MRI, metabolic measurements, and long-term follow-up,
      we showed that when fasting is done properly, the body adapts and remains protected.
      Potential adverse effects are known, expected, and medically managed.
    </p>

    <p>
      This knowledge is why, when you come to the clinic, you do not simply stop eating and drink water.
      You follow a precise, scientifically established programme,
      refined through decades of care and more than thirty published scientific articles.
    </p>

    <p>
      Today, the scientific department is led by Dr Robin Mesnage,
      a researcher ranked among the top one percent of scientists worldwide,
      known for his work on how the environment and lifestyle affect human health.
      Under his leadership, research has expanded to study what happens after fasting,
      during food reintroduction, and how patients can be supported when they return home.
    </p>

    <p>
      We work closely with institutions such as King’s College London,
      ETH Zurich, Charité Berlin, and Princeton University,
      and we share our findings at international medical conferences.
      This gives us access to research-grade diagnostics and the most recent scientific knowledge,
      sometimes before they enter routine clinical care.
    </p>

    <p>
      We do not use science as decoration.
      We do not rely on the work of others to appear scientific.
      We produce our own science, directly connected to the care we provide.
    </p>

    <p>
      Today, no other clinic, hospital, or university has accumulated this level of
      clinical experience and scientific data on fasting, year after year, in thousands of patients.
      This is why we are often described as the leading laboratory for human fasting.
    </p>

    <p>
      For our patients, this means something simple and essential.
      You are not trying an experiment.
      You are entering a method that is known, measured, and continuously improved.
    </p>

    <p>
      Fasting, when guided properly, is not about deprivation.
      It is about giving the body the conditions it needs to recover,
      safely, calmly, and with confidence.
